# PolicyD v2 (codenamed "cluebringer") is a multi-platform policy server
# for popular MTAs. This policy daemon is designed mostly for large
# scale mail hosting environments. The main goal is to implement as many
# spam combating and email compliance features as possible while at the
# same time maintaining the portability, stability and performance
# required for mission critical email hosting of today. Most of the
# ideas and methods implemented in PolicyD v2 stem from PolicyD v1
# as well as the authors' long time involvement in large scale mail
# hosting industry.
