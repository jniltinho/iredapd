Use prefork, we cannot guarantee how long the plugins/modules will take to run and don't want to holdup other queries

--------------

Immediate requirements:

- Whitelist/Blacklist of email addy or sending server or regex on reverse dns name  (2.1)
* This should allow an admin to whitelist a sender and bypass all future checks for a sending email addy

- Greylisting: regex   (2.1)
* Option, bypass greylisting for non-dynamic reverse DNS hosts
* Option, bypass greylisting for hosts where HELO == reverse dns
* Option to train only

- CheckHelo Blacklisting against regex/wildcard?  (2.1)
* Select the current helo's and compare to the helo blacklist list

- Add server IP column to tables to track which server is adding/updating?  (2.1)

- option to not add timestamps to logs (we capture logs with daemontools which adds (numeric) timestamps)  (2.1)
* log_timestamp=false in options

- Email notification when hosts are added to whitelist/blacklist  (2.1)

* Blacklist on excessive greylist retries, ie 50 in 1 minute ... etc. (2.1)
- num triplets?
- num attempts?

- Spamtrap where the IP address get blacklisted for configurable time period per trap (2.1)

- Allow configuration if postmaster@ bypasses tests (2.1) (#4)

- Web interface
* BCC To in amavis plugin needs Merge option, don't overwrite fields offer merge option?
* Add "enable" box so new entries are not disabled automagically apon adding

- Quotas based on per-recipient and per-message sent, make this optional. (2.1)

- Special treatment of    user+something@domain    and changing to   user@domain, global config option   (2.1)

- Template based replies for greylisting, helo checks ... etc  (2.1)

- Configurable rejection messages for all modules  (2.1)

- Honor bypass_mode for all db queries (2.1)

--------------

Planned Features:

* Milter support as a different Protocol

* Commandline tool to check the flow of policy matching and the verdicts

* GUI support to see which modules are linked to the policy (using an api to register each modules' check function)

* Add firewall rules for abuse greylisted hosts?

* Caching (2.2)

* ability to disable tcp connection logs while keeping action=* logs (perhaps move the latter from info to notice?)
